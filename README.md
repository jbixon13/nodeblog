## Really...another blog website?
This one is different, I promise. 

I've been drawn to beautiful and engaging narratives wherever they exist on the web. I discovered The Pudding shortly after they launched and fell in love with their style of communication. They may not be the first publication to use formats like scrollytelling to engage their audience, but they stick out to me as masters of visual storytelling. 

I have learned some of the basics of web development over the past year to share the work I do and make it more engaging. Most of that has involved using R packages to create interactive analyses. I've learned a lot, but I've not yet scratched the itch to make a truly engaging narrative that emulates my inspirations.
