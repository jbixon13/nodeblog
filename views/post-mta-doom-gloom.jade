        p It's no secret that New Yorkers love to hate their subway system. I was inspired to more critically analyze it after reading this #[a(href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/04/why-new-york-city-stopped-building-subways/557567/") CityLab] article that contextualizes the history of the MTA. I am specifically interested in whether it truly is degrading by using their publically maintained performance metrics. Some of these metrics have opaque names, so I'll specify where necessary.

A train is counted as on-time if it arrives at its destination early, on time, or no more than five minutes late, and has not skipped any planned stops. TOTP is a legacy metric that provides a measure of trains arriving within the standard, and not a direct measure of customer travel time, particularly since relatively few customers travel all the way to the end of a line." - MTA
